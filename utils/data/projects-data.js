        description: "Me and my team built an AI-powered car price prediction app that analyzes the Algerian market. We used XGBoost to develop the prediction model, trained on real market data. The frontend was built with React.js for a smooth user experience, while the backend, powered by Node.js, handled predictions and user interactions. To enhance the app visually, I created 3D car models using Three.js, adding an interactive experience. We also integrated web scraping tools to fetch real-time data from Algerian marketplaces for accurate pricing insights.",
